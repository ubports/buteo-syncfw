/*! \brief   About this class.
 *     We can't call Qt functions from Unix signal handlers.We can only call async-signal-safe functions from signal handlers.
 *          So this provides a way to use Unix signal handlers with Qt. The strategy is to have our Unix signal handler will eventually
 *          cause a Qt signal to be emitted, and then we simply return from our Unix signal handler.
 *          Back in our Qt program, that Qt signal gets emitted and then received by our Qt slot function, where we are safely doing Qt stuff
 *          which weren't allowed to do in the Unix signal handler.
 *    One simple way to make this happen is declares a socket pair in our class for each Unix signal we want to handle.
 *          The socket pairs are declared as static data members.We also created a QSocketNotifier to monitor the read end of each socket pair,
 *          declare your Unix signal handlers to be static class methods, and declare a slot function corresponding to each of our
 *          Unix signal handlers. In this class, we intend to handle both the SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals.
